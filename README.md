# Recurrent neural network for price prediction

In this case study, we use Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) layers to predict the price of Google stock. LSTM is a more sophisticated version of RNN that addresses the Vanishing Gradient Problem that RNNs often suffer from. 

# Data Analysis 1: Google Stock Price Prediction
We have used <a href = "https://github.com/TatevKaren/recurrent-neural-network-pricing-model/tree/main/data">Google stock price data</a>, publicly available and downloaded from Yahoo Finance. For training the model we have used stock prices for the period of 2016-2020 and used it to predict stock prices for the January of 2021.

## Google Data Preprocessing

In order to prepare the data to train and test RNN model we have performed certain data preprocessing steps using Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries. Detailed info about data preprocessing can be found in <a href = "https://github.com/TatevKaren/recurrent-neural-network-pricing-model/blob/main/Recurrent_Neural_Networks_Case_Study.pdf"> Case Study Paper</a>

## Prediction Results

Comparing the real Google stock values and predicted Google stock values that are generated using RNN model, for the test period, the first month of 2021. RNN based on 5 LSTMs was able to properly predict all upward and downward trends as we see that the red line corresponding to the predicted stock prices follows the same pattern as the blue line which corresponds the real stock prices.

# Data Analysis 2: Bitcoin Price Prediction

The same method can be applied on different financial instruments such as Bitcoin. Check out an application of this on Bitcoin in my Medium Article called <a href = "https://tatev-aslanyan.medium.com/predicting-bitcoins-price-with-recurrent-neural-networks-a27b4d2d839"> Predicting Bitcoinâ€™s Price With Recurrent Neural Networks </a>

## Prediction Results

Comparing the real Bitcoin price values and predicted Bitcoin price values that are generated using RNN model, for the test period, the first 3 months of 2021. RNN based on 5 LSTMs was able to properly predict all upward and downward trends as we see that the red line corresponding to the predicted stock prices follows the same pattern as the blue line which corresponds the real stock prices.
